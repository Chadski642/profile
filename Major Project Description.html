  <p>My Industrial Technology Multimedia (ITM) Major project titled ‘the chosen one’ is a narrative music video I created using a variety of design <br> principles and processes for both film and music production. I intended to create a project that
    would
    act as an introductory stage to learning the <br> skills of both my interests and passions; film and music. My main motivations during the completion of my major work was to expand my skillsets <br> I was passionate about while entertaining and
    inspiring
    my peers.</p>
  <p>I made the decision to use the Adobe Creative Suite, industry standard programs for producing graphical and video related aspects of projects. <br> This tool is different from similar programs due to its relatively easy nature for transforming
    concepts into content and has also gained high popularity <br> on the web. For me, this meant free/accessible sources for learning Adobe programs which greatly assisted many parts of my music video, <br> especially integrating certain VFX
    techniques such
    as:
    creating a sky replacement to depict a storm, making portals, and using miniatures by <br> chromakeying a toy to manipulate the scale of the object.
    With respect to music production, Ableton Live 10 is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) <br> I used to produce the music part of my project. Although I only had the lite version, this program was highly suitable for me, especially with its
    friendly <br>
    beginner user interface for compiling different sounds and manipulating waveforms to get the SC-FI, EDM track I was going for.
  </p>
  <p>With all the technologies that were available to me, I saw this as an opportunity for me to put together a project that would not only be the standard <br> of industry quality processes, but to also develop my own style in the process.</p>
  <p>Research played a massive role in my learning process. Research not only allowed me to learn how to carry out certain multimedia related processes,<br> it also acted as a form of inspiration through analysing existing projects, which inspired
    many
    concepts included in my music video. From my project I learnt how to: <br> create and mix melodies, learn camera functions, integrate VFX and colour correction/grading. It was also valuable to learn other things outside of industry specific
    processes <br>
    such as project management procedures related to time and finances; the most challenging factors of my project.</p>
  <p>The most valuable part of my major work’s completion was watching a finished scene I created using VFX and showing it to my intended audience (my peers). <br> This brought me into the imaginary world I intended, where my planned concepts and
    ideas
    were ‘SHAPED’ into the finished product I desired.</p>
